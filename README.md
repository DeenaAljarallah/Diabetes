**Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques**

Diabetes is a common chronic disease and poses a great threat to human health. The characteristic of diabetes is that the blood glucose is higher than the normal level, which is caused by defective insulin secretion or its impaired biological effects, or both (Lonappan et al., 2007). Diabetes can lead to chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, especially eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels and nerves (Krasteva et al., 2011).

With the development of living standards, diabetes is increasingly common in people&#39;s daily life. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the world&#39;s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes.

Therefore, how to diagnose and analyze diabetes is a topic worthy studying quickly and accurately. The earlier diagnosis is obtained, the much easier we can control it. Machine learning can help people make a preliminary judgment about diabetes mellitus according to their daily physical examination data, and it can serve as a reference for doctors (Lee and Kim, 2016; Alghamdi et al., 2017; Kavakiotis et al., 2017). For machine learning method, how to select the valid features and the correct classifier are the most important problems.

**Data**

This [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)( Please click here to view the dataset) is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**Hypothesis:**
1.	Diabetes during pregnancy has increased in recent years. From 2000 to 2010, the percentage of pregnant women with gestational diabetes increased 56%
2.	Any increase in BMI above normal weight levels is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed as having complications of diabetes mellitus.

**Goal**

My goal is to build a machine learning model to predict patients with diagnosed diabetes based on the given information in the dataset also to help doctors in early disease detection, early detection saves lives and improve health!
